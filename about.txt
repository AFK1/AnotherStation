I hate SS(13 and 14) for strange gameplay (lol, I don't like rp), for some conflicts, for the weird code and for the politics

That's why I did it.

If you want, you can host your own server and support this project, it's free (license is like beerware (I call it milkware))

in "SS_problems.txt" I am writing all the problems that I see in all games/servers like ss13/14,
if anyone fixes ALL these problems, I will archive this project
